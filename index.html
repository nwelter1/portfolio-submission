            <h4> July 2019 - April 2020</h4>
                <p>I worked at Yelp full time for almost 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic. My main focus was selling Yelp advertising
                     solutions to small businesses around the country. I helped business-owners attract more customers by creating custom 
                     advertising packages based on their own unique challenges. This job helped me develop a new skillset in public presentations, 
                     negotiation, and overall sales pursuit.<br><br> </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="Images/DJNate.jpg" height = "300" width="300" alt="Nate Welter" class="profilephoto"/>
            <p> My name is Nate Welter. I grew up in Elkhart, IN. After graduating from Indiana University 
                in 2017, I moved to Chicago to pursue a career in the music industry. After several ups and 
                downs over the past 3 years, I still work in music, but have decided to make a career-shift 
                into the tech world. I have always been fascinated with the concept of programming, but I have 
                only recently started learning myself! I'm hoping to apply the knowledge I gain from this course to a music-related field.
            </p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I am extremely passionate about music. Outside of work, my main hobbies are almost all about music.
                 I spend most nights/weekends either DJing, attending/hosting concerts, or producing music with my friends!</p>
            <p>I am also a huge outdoor person, and love everything extreme sports. Some of my favorite activities
                 are:</p>
